# LootrTweaker - Planned Features

This document outlines upcoming features planned for the LootrTweaker mod.

## Advanced Loot Distribution

### Loot Quality Scaling
- **Distance-based scaling**: Loot quality increases based on distance from spawn
- **Depth-based scaling**: Better loot at deeper Y-levels
- **Dimension-specific scaling**: Different scaling factors for each dimension (Overworld, Nether, End)
- **Player statistic scaling**: Loot quality based on player statistics (mobs killed, blocks mined, etc.)

### Biome & Structure Specific Loot
- **Biome-specific loot tables**: Configure different loot probabilities based on biome types
- **Structure-specific loot**: Special items exclusive to certain structures
  - Desert temples have more gold and emeralds
  - Ocean monuments contain unique prismarine treasures
  - Woodland mansions yield rare enchanted books

## Progression-Based Loot Systems

### Player Progression Gating
- **Time-based progression**: Better loot as more in-game days pass
- **Achievement-based loot**: Unlock new possible items after completing specific advancements
- **Boss-defeat triggers**: Defeating bosses (Ender Dragon, Wither) unlocks higher tier loot globally
- **Player statistics thresholds**: Unlock better loot after reaching certain statistics milestones

### Seasonal & Time-Based Variations

- **Day/Night cycle variations**: Different loot tables during day vs. night
- **Moon phase effects**: Special rare items only appear during full moons
- **Weather-dependent loot**: Special items during thunderstorms
- **Seasons compatibility**: Integration with seasons mods for seasonal loot variations

## Treasure Hunt Mechanics

### Map Generation System
- **Treasure map generation**: Configurable chance to find maps to other treasure locations
- **Map quality tiers**: Common maps lead to small treasures, rare maps lead to valuable caches
- **Nested treasure hunts**: Find maps inside treasure chests that lead to more valuable treasures

### Cryptic Clues System
- **Lore books generation**: Create book and quill items with cryptic clues about:
  - Nearby treasure locations
  - Hints about loot mechanics
  - Riddles that reveal special item locations
- **Progressive clue system**: Books found in early-game contain clues relevant to mid-game treasures

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching system**: Cache loot table modifications for better performance
- **Conditional processing**: Only process relevant loot tables when needed

### Integration & Compatibility
- **API for other mods**: Allow other mods to register custom loot conditions
- **Better compatibility**: Enhanced compatibility with other loot-modifying mods
